        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Chicken (whole or chicken parts like thighs or breasts)</li>
            <li>Jasmine rice</li>
            <li>Chicken broth</li>
            <li>Garlic</li>
            <li>Ginger</li>
            <li>Sesame oil</li>
            <li>Vegetable oil</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Chili sauce</li>
            <li>Ginger paste</li>
            <li>Soup (optional, made with chicken broth)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Rinse the jasmine rice thoroughly, then cook it in chicken broth for extra flavor.</li>
            <li>In a large pot, bring water to a boil and add the chicken. Poach the chicken for about 30-40 minutes until fully cooked, or roast it in the oven if preferred.</li>
            <li>While the chicken cooks, heat some vegetable oil in a pan and sauté the garlic and ginger until fragrant.</li>
            <li>Add the cooked rice to the pan with the sautéed garlic and ginger. Drizzle sesame oil over the rice and mix well to coat.</li>
            <li>Once the chicken is cooked, remove it from the pot, rub with a little sesame oil, and season with salt. Then, slice the chicken into pieces.</li>
            <li>Serve the sliced chicken over the rice and accompany it with chili sauce and ginger paste on the side.</li>
            <li>Optionally, serve with a small bowl of the chicken broth as a soup on the side.</li>
        </ol>
