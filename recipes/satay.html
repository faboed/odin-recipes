            <li>Coconut milk</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut the chicken, beef, or lamb into small cubes and marinate them in a mixture of soy sauce, garlic, turmeric, and coriander for at least 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Thread the marinated meat onto skewers, making sure the pieces are evenly spaced.</li>
            <li>Grill the skewers on medium heat, turning occasionally, until the meat is cooked through and slightly charred (about 5-7 minutes per side, depending on the meat).</li>
            <li>While the meat is grilling, prepare the peanut sauce by combining peanut butter, coconut milk, sugar, chili paste (if using), and lime juice in a saucepan. Heat over low heat until smooth and well combined.</li>
            <li>Serve the grilled satay with the peanut sauce on the side, accompanied by rice cakes and cucumber slices for a refreshing touch.</li>
